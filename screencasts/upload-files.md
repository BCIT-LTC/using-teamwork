Uploading Files

## Script

### In this screencast we're going to see how easy it is to upload files into Teamwork.

> Teamwork Dashboard (use demo account with only 2 projects)
	- zoom & highlight [Upload files button]()

### Teamwork is great for sharing files with your team.

> Project overview activity
	- highlight "... added a file"

> Files area (sorted by Name)
	- highlight names in activity list

### You can put files into categories just like you put files into folders on your computer.

> Files area (sorted by Name)
	- highlight Categories section

> Overlay: My Documents image - folders with same names as categories
	- highlight similarity of folder names

### You can search for files in the search box.

> Files area (sorted by Name)
	- zoom and highlight Search box with search results

### And file versioning is a great way to share the most current version of a document while keeping it's history.

> Project files area (sorted by Name)
	- zoom and highlight versions of the same file

### So let's get started. We'll assume that you already have a project, so click into your project.

> Teamwork Dashboard (use demo account with only 2 projects)
	- Click into project

### Click on the Files link and then take note of the Categories listed on the left hand side.

> Project Dashboard
	- zoom, highlight and click Files link

### In this project, where the team is developing an online course, there are file categories for each module that is being developed.

> Project files area (sorted by Name)
	- zoom and highlight Categories section

### Let's say you're working on something for Module 3 and you want to share your files with the team. Click on the `Mod 3` category link...

> Project files area (sorted by Name)
	- click Mod 3 category

### ... and then drag your files from your computer into the web page.

> Project files area (sorted by Name)
	- drag files from My Documents folder onto web page

### As soon as you release the files, Teamwork automatically uploads and categorizes them.

> Project files area (sorted by Name)
	- highlight upload progress bar

### If you have a new version to share, click the arrow button to the right of the file and click `Upload New Version`.

> Project files area (sorted by Name)
	- click down arrow
	- click Upload New Version link

### Drag the new version from your computer onto the `Add File` button and release it.

> Project files area (Upload New Version modal)
	- drag file from My Documents onto web page

### Click the `Upload New Version` button and Teamwork adds the new version while preserving links to the original file.

> Project files area (Upload New Version modal)
	- click Upload New Version button
